      An event ‘rejection’ is said to occur if the confidence interval excludes the null value of the parameter. The Probability &#123;Rejection&#125; refers to the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis – also referenced as the Power of the study.  In this context, the goal is to find an adequate sample size for given the power the investigator would like to achieve.
    </p>
    <p *ngIf="isCIWidth()" id="ciwidthdesc">
      An event ‘width’ is said to occur if the observed confidence interval width is less than a fixed constant chosen a priori. The Probability &#123;CI Width&#125; refers to the probability of achieving that event.  In this context, the goal is to find an adequate sample size given the probability the investigator would like to achieve.
    </p>
    <p *ngIf="isWAVR()" id="wavrdesc">
      An event ‘validity’ is said to occur if the parameter of interest is contained between the observed upper and lower confidence interval bounds. The Probability &#123;WAVR&#125; refers to the probability of achieving the Width AND a valid rejection of the null hypothesis.  In this context, the goal is to find an adequate sample size given the probability the investigator would like to achieve.
